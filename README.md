This is a Python program, and an update to an old Javascript game I published to my website in 2022. This Python game was made in 2024. It adds multiple characters,
multiple stages, the possibility to land in a pond or the rough, and both wind and cardinal directions that cause some calculations to be applied to the distance of the ball.
Although, as I recall, these calculations were still effectively one-dimensional back and forth sort of ball directions, just magnitudes, effected by multipliers and whatnot.

The characters have strength attributes. They say things, whihch are pulled from an array of dialogue lines. You can pick the opponents you want to play against.

There's a ranking system at the end.

If Spider Man is one of the players, there's a chance his spidey senses will go off and he'll abandon the game to go fight crime. This causes the game instance to end.
When rounds get jammed, or if you want to restart the game, you have to restart the program. I unfortunately did not end up adding a restart function to the game
that wipes all the variables.
