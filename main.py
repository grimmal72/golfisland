# I've been having an unfortunate problem where the necessary ceil function for rounding leads to infinite "2" shots. That is, swings with position changes of zero. If I use the floor function for rounding, I sometimes get infinite "0" shots. The solution? To implement the bottom three variables for usage in a conditional. If a shot magnitude is repeated three times, the character will switch to the opposite function, which will hopefully resolve the infinite rounding error.
